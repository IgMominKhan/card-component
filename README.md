## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I have learned the CSS property `Background-blend-mode`, And two HTML attributes `Src-set and sizes`. I have also learned how to make responsive designs with CSS flexbox.

### Continued development

This project does not have cross-browser support. I will add this feature later.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) - This helped me to learn background-blend mode. I really liked this CSS property and will use it going forward.
